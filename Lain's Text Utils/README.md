A collection of useful TextMesh Rich Text Tag functions tied directly to strings.

Only those actually functional (currently) in Grey Hack have been included.

One version includes documentation and is meant to be used to GreybelVS.
The other is a version with no docs, able to be inserted and used directly in Grey Hack without building from Greybel.
